## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheSethRose/Time-Capsule.git
   cd Time-Capsule
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure settings in `config.json` according to your preferences.

## 🖥️ Usage

Start the Time Capsule application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start and display the URL for accessing the web interface. Use this interface to manage plugins and control the Time Capsule.

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to initiate a graceful shutdown of the application.

## 🧩 Plugin System

Time Capsule uses a plugin system for extensibility. Plugins are located in the `plugins` directory. Each plugin should be in its own subdirectory and contain a main class that matches the plugin name.

To create a new plugin:

1. Create a new directory in the `plugins` folder with your plugin name.
2. Create a Python file with the same name as your plugin.
3. Implement the main plugin class with `start()` and `stop()` methods.

Plugins can be enabled or disabled through the web interface or by modifying the `config.json` file.

## 🔧 Configuration

The `config.json` file contains various settings for the application, including:

- Database path
- Audio recording settings
- Transcription settings
- Plugin states
- Web interface refresh interval

Modify this file to customize the behavior of Time Capsule.
